# Micro-Climate-Forecast-using-Time-Series

(I) Project Objectives: 
-> Weather forecast is a challenging task since it is volatile in nature, thanks to various external factors such as location, wind, moisture etc. Historical data acts as an aid to understand and estimate the possible weather conditions in the future.</br>
-> This project is one such initiative, where micro-climatic conditions (Temperature, Humidity and Pressure) is predicted on an hourly basis for five days, based on one year of historical data.</br>

(II) Dataset: Consists of over 26,000 rows and has 3 features: Sensor type (Humidity, Temperature and Pressure), Sensor readings and the time at which the values of recorded. <br>

(III) Libraries: <br>
(a) Prophet <br>
(b) Pandas <br>
(c) Numpy <br>
(d) Matplotlib <br>
(e) Scikit-Learn <br>

(IV) A short intro to Time Series? <br>
-> Time Series Analysis is capturing and understanding the pattern in an historical data over a period of time. An observed time series analysis can be decomposed into three components: Trend (Long term direction), Seasonality (Systematic changes based on calendar events) and finally irregular (Short term fluctuations). </br>

(V) Applications of Time Series: <br>
-> Some of the important applications of Time Series Analysis are as follows: </br>
(1) Stock Market Analysis </br>
(2) Sales Forecasting </br>
(3) Yield Projection </br>
(4) Weather Forecasting </br>
