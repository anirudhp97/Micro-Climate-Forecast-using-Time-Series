# Micro-Climate-Forecast-using-Time-Series

-> Weather forecast is a challenging task since it is volatile in nature, thanks to various external factors such as location, wind, moisture etc. Historical data acts as an aid to understand and estimate the possible weather conditions in the future.</br>
-> This project is one such initiative, where micro-climatic conditions (Temperature, Humidity and Pressure) is predicted on an hourly basis for five days, based on one year of historical data.</br>
-> Time Series Analysis is capturing and understanding the pattern in an historical data over a period of time. An observed time series analysis can be decomposed into three components: Trend (Long term direction), Seasonality (Systematic changes based on calendar events) and finally irregular (Short term fluctuations). </br>

-> Some of the important applications of Time Series Analysis are as follows: </br>
(1) Stock Market Analysis </br>
(2) Sales Forecasting </br>
(3) Yield Projection </br>
(4) Weather Forecasting </br>
-> For this project AutoRegressive model was built using the Prophet library. Prophet is an open-source library developed by Facebook. It allows seamless training and prediction of time series data, and can be implemented in both Python and R. </br>
-> Link to the Prophet Library (https://facebook.github.io/prophet/). </br>
-> Although the models were built successfully for each factor, it is not feasible since multiple models were used to capture the trend and make indiviual prediction. This cannot be feasible if similar models are deplpoyed into productions. </br>
-> The dataset used is from a private source.
